Data Extraction with Regular Expressions
Overview
This project involves the development of a web application that aggregates data from various sources and displays relevant information based on user requests. The application utilizes a custom API to extract specific data types from hundreds of pages of strings. The extracted data types include Movie Titles, Song Lyrics, Twitter Usernames, ISBN numbers, Jokes, TV Episode Titles, Dates, Hex Color Codes, and IP Addresses.  The extraction method involves identifying characters that specify match patterns. These patterns are used by string-searching algorithms to 
identify similar characters of texts in a string.

Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex) are used to define patterns for each data type to be extracted from the string responses obtained from the API.
They are a fast and powerful method to search, extract and replace specific data found in documents.
